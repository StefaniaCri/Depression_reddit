# Depression_reddit
Because depression is more common in today's culture, it is important to have reliable instruments for diagnosing and treating it. In this paper, we gather and annotate a mental health dataset for texts written in Romanian on Reddit, with a special focus on depression. In order to create our dataset, we took posts that talked about depression and mental health out of subreddits in Romanian. Due to the relative rarity of relevant posts, the dataset's size was constrained; however, extensive annotation procedures were applied to guarantee its quality and applicability. After that, we analyzed the data using traditional text classification techniques as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). Furthermore, we made use of BERT  to take advantage of its cutting-edge text interpretation and classification capabilities.
